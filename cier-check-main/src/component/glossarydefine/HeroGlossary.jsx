In some cases, acquired mutations can lead to cancer. This is different from inherited mutations, which are present at birth and in almost all the cells of the body. Acquired mutations are not passed on to children.</p>

                    <p>A benign (not cancer) growth of abnormal glandular cells. These can become cancer, so they are usually removed when found. For example, 3 types of adenomas that can grow in the colon are tubular, villous, and tuberovillous. In each type, the cells are arranged differently, but there is some overlap so that an adenoma can have both tubular and villous features. See also glandular cells, hyperplastic polyp, inflammatory polyp, polyp, tubular adenoma,villous adenoma.</p>

                    <p>Cancer that has spread from where it started (the primary site) to other parts of the body. When the cancer has grown outside the body part where it started but has not yet spread to other parts of the body, it is called locally advanced cancer. If it has spread to other parts of the body, it is called metastatic cancer.</p>
                    <h4 className='text-2xl font-bold'>aggressive cancer</h4>

                    <p>American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system helps determine how much and where the cancer is in the body using the TNM system. T describes the tumor’s size, location, and if it has grown into nearby areas. N describes the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes, and M describes metastasis (the spread of cancer to distant parts of the body).</p>
                    <h4 className='text-2xl font-bold'>allogeneic stem cell transplant [A-loh-jeh-NAY-ik]</h4>

                    <h4 className='text-2xl font-bold'>alternative medicine
                    </h4>
                    <p>An unproven or disproven therapy that is used instead of standard (proven) medical treatment. Some examples of alternative medicines are special diets, certain supplements or herbs, or high doses of vitamins. The American Cancer Society recommends that patients thinking about using any alternative therapy discuss it first with a member of their cancer care team. Some alternative therapies are known to cause harmful or even life-threatening side effects. With others, the main danger is that the patient may lose the chance to benefit from standard treatment.

In women, estrogen levels normally cycle on a monthly schedule to regulate menstruation and prepare the body for fertilization and reproduction. Estrogen may promote the growth of cancer cells in breast, endometrial, and adrenal cancers.

                    <p>The most commonly used system to stage cancers. The TNM staging system uses 3 key pieces of information.
                        <ul className='list-disc'>
                            <li>T refers to the size of the tumor</li>
                            <li>N describes whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, and if so, how many</li>
                            <li>M shows whether the cancer has spread (metastasized) to other organs of the body</li>

                        </ul>

                        Letters or numbers after the T, N, and M give more details about each of these factors. To make this information clearer, the TNM descriptions can be grouped together into a simpler set of stages, labeled with Roman numerals (usually from I to IV). In general, the lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number means a more serious cancer. Also called AJCC staging system.

                    <h4 className=' '>Summary:</h4>
                    <p className=' px-16'>Medical researchers have developed an approach for detecting breast cancer by means of urine samples. The method involves determining the concentration of molecules that regulate cell metabolism and that are often dysregulated in cancer cells. These molecules, referred to as microRNAs, enter into the urine over the blood. By determining the composition of microRNAs in the urine, the scientists succeeded in establishing with 91 percent accuracy whether a test subject was healthy or diseased.</p>

                    <h4 className='text-6xl font-bold'>CA 15-3</h4>

                    <h4 className='text-4xl font-bold'>Does this test have other names?</h4>

                    <p>Cancer antigen 15-3</p>

                    <h4 className='text-4xl font-bold'>What is this test?</h4>

                    <p>This test measures the amount of cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) in your blood. CA 15-3 is a substance that stimulates your body’s defense system. Some kinds of cancer cells release the CA 15-3 antigen into the blood. This test is used to monitor certain types of cancer.</p>
                    <p>Breast cancer is the cancer most likely to release CA 15-3, especially in cases where the breast cancer recurs after treatment. Antigens like CA 15-3 that provide information about cancer are called tumor markers.</p>

                    <h4 className='text-4xl font-bold'>Why do I need this test?</h4>
                    <br />
                    <p>You may need this test to monitor your body’s response to treatment for breast cancer. CA 15-3 is not used as a screening test or a diagnostic test to detect breast cancer. Some individuals with breast cancer do not have elevated levels of CA 15-3. Additionally, conditions other than breast cancer can cause a positive CA 15-3 test.</p>
                    <p>You may need this test if:
                        <ul className=' px-10 list-disc'>
                            <li>You have already been diagnosed with breast cancer and your healthcare provider wants to find out how well treatment is working.</li>
                            <li>You have already been treated for breast cancer and your healthcare provider wants to find out if your cancer has come back or spread.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h4 className='text-4xl font-bold'>What other tests might I have along with this test?</h4>

                    <p>Your healthcare provider may order a test to check for another breast cancer tumor marker called CA 27-29. You may also have other blood and diagnostic tests to learn about your cancer.</p>

                    <h4 className='text-4xl font-bold'>What do my test results mean?</h4>

                    <p>Test results may vary depending on your age, gender, health history, and other factors. Your test results may differ depending on the lab used. They may not indicate a problem. Ask your healthcare provider what your test results mean for you.</p>
                    <p>CA 15-3 is measured in units per milliliter (U/mL). A normal test should be less than or equal to 30 U/mL.</p>
                    <p>It is important to know that a positive CA 15-3 blood test does not mean you have breast cancer or that your breast cancer has returned. Other conditions can also cause CA 15-3 levels to be elevated.</p>
                    <p>Noncancerous conditions of the breast, ovary, and liver can also lead to increased CA 15-3 levels.</p>
                    <p>The results of this test are evaluated alongside other clinical information. In general, increasing values may indicate disease progression or recurrence, while decreasing values may suggest disease regression.</p>

                    <h4 className='text-4xl font-bold'>How is this test done?</h4>

                    <p>The test is performed using a blood sample. A needle is used to draw blood from a vein in your arm or hand.</p>

                    <h4 className='text-4xl font-bold'>Does this test pose any risks?</h4>

                    <p>Having a blood test with a needle carries some risks, including bleeding, infection, bruising, and feeling lightheaded. When the needle pricks your arm or hand, you may feel a slight sting or pain. Afterward, the site may be sore.</p>

                    <h4 className='text-4xl font-bold'>What might affect my test results?</h4>

                    <p>Other factors aren’t likely to affect your results.</p>

                    <h4 className='text-4xl font-bold'>How do I get ready for this test?</h4>

                    <p>You don’t need to prepare for this test. Ensure your healthcare provider knows about all medicines, herbs, vitamins, and supplements you are taking, including over-the-counter medications and any illegal drugs.</p>
